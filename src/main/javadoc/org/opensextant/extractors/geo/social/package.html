    <h1>Social Geoinferencing</h1>
    <p>In 2013 when OpenSextant was first released, we had a demo of how
      to parse tweets. That was fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, what we've
      done with Xponents here is to develop a methodology for
      georeferencing any variety of data.&nbsp; The terms
      geoinferencing, geocoding, geotagging seem to blur.&nbsp; But for
      all intents and purposes what we mean is:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to detect all reasonable geographic cues in data, social media
        and other data alike</li>
      <li>extract and report known entities supporting geographic
        intelligence: language, culture, nationality, etc.</li>
      <li>provide a sense of confidence of codings and location accuracy</li>
      <li>provide a rules trace of rules that fired arriving the
        geocoding <br>
      </li>
      <li>provide reasonable means for "tagging": meaning serializing
        data or persisting it in durable forms, e.g., inject geocode
        into a JSON subdocument or export a database schema (CSV
        headings) that are easy to interpret</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This package applies mainly <b>SolrGazetteer</b>, <b>XCoord</b>
      and <b>PlaceGeocoder</b> in these classes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>XponentsTextGeotagger</b>: demonstrate tagging social media
        text where there is additional metadata about user, location,
        profile.&nbsp; This derives the geographic topics or locations
        in a post.</li>
      <li><b>XponentsGeocoder</b>: demonstrate the heuristic metadata
        rules for dealing with sparse inputs, as is the case with most
        social media. Xponents application here looks at finding the
        highest fidelity location associated with a user profile based
        on given country, location description, device GPS location,
        timezone and UTC offset.&nbsp; The language of the post is
        compared to the primary language of any inferred Countries, as
        is the timezone of the post.&nbsp; Such things help disambiguate
        free text descriptions of one's home location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These <b>Geoinferencers</b> provide a base illustration for how
      other algorithms could extract and report discrete location
      intelligence.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>SimpleProcessorDemo</b> demonstrates using the <b>TweetLoader</b>
      to load JSON formatted data, process it, and output it as CSV or
      KML (using <b>KMLDemoWriter</b> and the stock OpenSextant output
      schema)<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>SimpleProcessorDemo usage:<br>
    </h2>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir -p output<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j</code><code>ava --cp lib/* </code><code><code>-Dopensextant.solr=./solr/solr7
        -Xmx2g -Xms2g \</code><code><br>
        &nbsp; </code></code><code><code></code><code>&nbsp; org.opensextant.extractors.geo.social.</code>SimpleProcessorDemo
      \</code><code></code><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --phase
      xponents-text --in src/test/resources/sample-tweets.json \</code><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --out
      ./output/sample-tweets+geocoded.json \<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --kml&nbsp;
      ./output/sample-tweets.kml</code><br>
    <br>
    The output is then a Geocoded JSON file as well as a KML file.&nbsp;
