    <h1>Geo Extraction: PlaceGeocoder, SolrGazetteer, GazetteerMatcher
      and related items</h1>
    <p> This package is all about complete geotagging of unstructured
      text, and any supporting functions. The foundation of this is the
      Gazetteer and the tagger -- represented by <code>SolrGazetteer</code>
      and <code>GazetteerMatcher</code>, respectively. The gazetteer is
      the database of all the place names, abbreviations, codes and
      location information. The tagger is a Solr handler on top of the
      database. <i>(Here "database" == "solr index"</i>). </p>
    <p> Now the fun part: PlaceGeocoder. This is a complex rules
      processor for all geotagging and geocoding work in pure Java. Lots
      of internal resource dependencies are involved: gazetteer,
      resource files, lookup tables, configuration data, tuning
      parameters. But the API is simple:&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>initialize</b>: <code>PlaceGeocoder p = new
          PlaceGeocoder(); /* optionally: */ p.setParameters(...);</code>
      </li>
      <li> <b>use</b>: <code>List&lt;TextMatch&gt; results =
          p.extract( input )</code></li>
    </ul>
    PlaceGeocoder is based on the Xponents geocoding methodology: <a
href="https://github.com/OpenSextant/Xponents/blob/master/doc/Geocoder_Handbook.md"
      target="xponents">https://github.com/OpenSextant/Xponents/blob/master/doc/Geocoder_Handbook.md</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The rules package is a collection of implemented GeocodeRules that
    operate on PlaceCandidates found in your input text.&nbsp; Each rule
    may look at the match itself, the candidate locations behind the
    match or the surrounding evidence near the match or within the
    document.&nbsp; The general approach of the geocoder is:<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Extract hard evidence </b>first, e.g., acceptable
        resolution coordinates in text or metadata for document ==&gt;
        infers Country and or Province.&nbsp; Note, that hard evidence
        is not always available in the text.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Use language ID of text </b>==&gt; guides text
        tokenization, matching and filtering of matches.&nbsp; In rich
        metadata scenarios, language of data may also indirectly infer
        Country of origin or of topic.&nbsp; (see <code>Country</code>
        data class which has primary language and timezone information)</li>
      <li>Decorate candidates / input document <b>obvious soft evidence
        </b>==&gt; mentions of countries by name or well-known
        abbreviations of provinces infer geographic region and weight
        location names in those regions higher.</li>
      <li><b>Filter</b> obvious false positives ==&gt; organizations or
        person names that are confounded with place names</li>
      <li><b>Choose location</b> ==&gt; given all the evidence assign
        rules for the choices made and a confidence level (a relative
        score on a 100 point scale)</li>
      <li><b>Emit all matches</b>: filtered "out" matches are marked as
        such; matches may be PlaceCandidate, TaxonMatch (org or person),
        GeocoordMatch.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the caller receives the List of TextMatch, all of the rules
      and other metadata can be accessed through the data classes
      APIs.&nbsp; Caller must cast TextMatch to subclass to leverage
      such methods.<br>

        Geo-inferencing on Tweets:&nbsp; <b>XponentsTextGeotagger</b>
        and <b>XponentsGeocoder</b> are PlaceGeocoder applicatons
        driven by the demo SimpleProcessorDemo.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Xlayer (subproject) XGeo REST service.&nbsp; This is a Restlet
        application that provisions a PlaceGeocoder as a RESTful
        extractor.<br>
