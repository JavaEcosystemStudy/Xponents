#Migrating from v1.7 to v2.0#
=============================


Namespaces: 
  org.mitre.xyz  or 
  org.mitre.opensextant.xyz  or   -----> org.opensextant.xyz

Package Re-org by folders:

* Most previous Xponent stuff was moved to Core

* Commons was merged into Core (util, data, etc)

* XText has a major dependency on Tika;  and since users data may never require XText 
 it was not moved into the Core.

* Structure is fully-Mavenized
  + use javadoc folder (instead of package-info.java in src/main/java)

* Actual folder layout:
