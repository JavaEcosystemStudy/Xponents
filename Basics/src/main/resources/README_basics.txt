Basic Resources include the following:
----------

feature metadata - plain language descriptions for each of the Geonames feature classes and codes. 
country names mapped to FIPS, ISO2, and ISO3 country codes.
 +  See OpenSextant Gazetteer project ETL resources that provides that Universal Gazetteer Model

Language metadata  -- mapping language trigraph/digraph to names. Using the ISO-639-2 standard.
+ Java language does not provide full list of languages for supported Locales.  IBM ICU4J does not do much better.
