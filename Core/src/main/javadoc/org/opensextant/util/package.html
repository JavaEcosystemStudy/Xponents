    <h1>Utilities for Extraction</h1>
    <p>Don't get me wrong -- there are a lot of good utilities already
      out there for NLP work.&nbsp; I found using Apache Commons
      StringUtils, File*Utils and other APIs very helpful.&nbsp;
      However, there are some oddities in the Java and Unicode world
      that need handling, as well as in the standards world where
      reasonable metadata is just missing.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>FileUtility</b> -- provides some simpler method calls and
        macro-like calls for common things.&nbsp; Most often used
        resource is just readFile(path, encoding)</li>
      <li><b>GeodeticUtility</b> -- simple geo math, validation and some
        geohash utilities</li>
      <li><b>TextUtils</b> and <b>UnicodeTextUtils</b> -- text buffer
        cleanup routines;&nbsp; Language metadata and simple language
        detection. UnicodeTextUtils has Java7-specific symbol names for
        high order Unicode pages with items like emoticons and silly,
        newer stuff.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>GeonamesUtility</b> -- a helper for working with country
        metadata: ISO, FIPS, names and codes.</li>
      <li><b>SolrProxy</b> -- a catch-all for interfacing with Solr
        index or server. The primary use cases here are interfacing
        Extractors with their underlying SolrTextTagger<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
