    <h1> Extraction Fundamentals
    </h1>
    <p>Extraction fundamentals include <tt>TextEntity</tt>, a span in free text, and <tt>TextMatch</tt> a 
    TextEntity generated by an extractor, matcher, or rule.  A span is defined as a character start offset 
    and end offset.  A TextEntity provides basic reasoning for span logic and math:  compare spans before, after
    within, overlap, etc.
    
    <p>Beyond that, the extraction helpers here provide specific Solr tagger support, match filteration,
    match navigation, and match metrics.
