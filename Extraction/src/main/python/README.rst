OpenSextant Python Utilities and APIs
=====================================
This library is a place holder for more OpenSextant/Python work to come.
Currently it has two main functions:

- act as an ETL tool for getting taxonomies into XTax (a solr-text-tagger application )
- provide classes for familiar vocabulary:  Country, Location, Place, etc.
