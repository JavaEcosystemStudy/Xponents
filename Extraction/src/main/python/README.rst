OpenSextant Python Utilities and APIs
=====================================
This library is a place holder for more OpenSextant/Python work to come.
At this time this opensextant v1.0 is nowhere near a 1:1 match for the Java Xponents version of tools in this repo.

Currently this module  has two main functions:

- act as an ETL tool for getting taxonomies into XTax (a solr-text-tagger application )
- provide classes for familiar vocabulary:  Country, Location, Place, etc.
