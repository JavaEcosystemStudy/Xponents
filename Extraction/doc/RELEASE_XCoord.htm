    <h2>XCoord RELEASE NOTES</h2>
    <p><br>
      <b>XCoord 2.0 2013-July Independence Release<br>
      </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Xponents now fully maven built, set apart from the
        "opensextant" super project.</li>
      <li>Improved concept of precision/resolution</li>
      <li>Added more MGRS filters and pattern refinements</li>
      <li>Parsing unbalanced pattern matches better now, while being
        more flexible with allowed punctuation.&nbsp; Managing false
        positives from looser patterns is important.&nbsp; E.g., pattern
        with +/-DEG&nbsp; DEG MIN SEC&nbsp; would be an imbalanced
        lat/lon pair where longitude is specified to seconds, but
        latitude is degrees only. Such a case is very much a false
        positive.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>XCoord 1.6 2013-MAR St Patrick's release</b><b><br>
      </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>MGRS date filtering for various common dates in recent time;
        for example 03 MAR 12<br>
      </li>
      <li>Allowing for "dashes" as separators between lat &amp; lon,
        where in some cases it may appear as a hemisphere sign.</li>
      <li>Introduction of Maven <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>XCoord v1.5 2013-JAN&nbsp; MLK release</b><b><br>
      </b>Major improvements<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for asymmetric coordinates;&nbsp; valid lat/lon
        formats that have varying resolution, e.g., 34:45N&nbsp;
        44:55:10W.&nbsp;&nbsp; valid MGRS grids with typos, e.g.,&nbsp;
        483QR 443 55 ( easting has 3 digits, northing should be
        "550");&nbsp; Grids with line breaks or interrupting
        whitespace,&nbsp; 483QR 44\n3 55;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grids with no
        whitespace, but invalid easting/northing, eg.
        483QR44355&nbsp;&nbsp; -- both 443 / 550 and 440 / 355 are
        emitted as potentially correct interpretations</li>
      <li>Allow for multiple interpretations of a coordinate pattern,
        e.g., MGRS case above where easting/northing is ambiguous due to
        typos.</li>
      <li>Testing data included patterns from wikipedia geotagging
        conventions for wiki pages.</li>
      <li>Expanded test cases</li>
      <li>Improved date filtering for DMS patterns with odd punctuation,
        e.g. 2012-12-11 10:45:00&nbsp;&nbsp; is a time not a
        coordinate.&nbsp; Two-digit year date/time patterns matched
        often.</li>
      <li>Consolidated patterns library primarily due to consideration
        of asymmetry in resolution.&nbsp; More smarts put into place in
        parsing/normalizing.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>XCoord v1.3, 2012-10-27 THANKSGIVING release</b></p>
    <p>Minor improvements:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>added more DM/DMS patterns to ensure coordinates with DMS
        symbols only and no indication of hemisphere (-,+, ENSW) are
        detected and parsed </li>
      <li>added such tests to Truth data; see GeocoderEval project</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>XCoord v1.2,&nbsp; 2012-10-31&nbsp; HALLOWEEN release</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Major improvements:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Precision</li>
      <li>Test &amp; Evaluation</li>
      <li>Rule order -- it is preserved and is currently MGRS UTM DMS DM
        DD<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed many rules, added others</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      Details<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concepts added/adjusted (org.mitre.xcoord pkg):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>GeocoordPrecision -- tracks number of digits mainly in DD,
          DM, DMS patterns, and the associated precision.</li>
        <li>Hemisphere&nbsp; -- tracks hemisphere if it is +/-, Alpha or
          null.</li>
        <li>PrecisionScales -- much improved assessment of inherent
          precision in any patter</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Testing added</li>
      <ul>
        <li>TestCase, TestScript added to capture input tests</li>
        <li>TestUtility improved to report truth data if given, and the
          carry both truth and test results along with output for
          evaluation later.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>UTMParser hemisphere detection fixed.&nbsp; "S" was allowed to
        be a Northern lat band, when it usually means South.</li>
      <li>DMSOrdinate now handles all logic for DD, DM, DMS parsing and
        calculation.&nbsp; Hemisphere parsing moved here (out of
        PatternManager)</li>
      <li>PatternManager --- ensure Rules order-of-appearance is
        preserved from configuration file</li>
      <li>GeocoordMatch -- formatting was a major concern, as with Java,
        printing a Float or Double allows near infinite decimal places
        (I mean a lot). Where you want 35.01,&nbsp; Java might print
        "35.00999989082911237", but you want "35.01" the string.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use GeocoordMatch.formatLatitude() or formatLongitude() to
          get a printable string version of the calculated lat or lon</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
